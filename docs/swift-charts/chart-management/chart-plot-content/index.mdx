    /// that's composed of built-in views that SwiftUI provides, plus other
    /// composite views that you've already defined:
    ///
    ///     struct MyView: View {
    ///         var body: some View {
    ///             Text("Hello, World!")

    /// When you create a custom view, Swift infers this type from your
    /// implementation of the required ``View/body-swift.property`` property.
